* isEmpty
* peek
* print

## Stack (Pila)

### Basic methods
* Node constructor
* LinkedList constructor
* add
* insertAt
* removeFrom

## Doubly Linked List (Lista doblemente enlazada)

## Hash table (Tabla hash)

## Difference between to array
The problem is to remove element of array, the array require passing indexation of all elements, and it is inefficient.
